        <p>I am a die-hard Minnesota Twins baseball fan and summers often find me at Target Field in Minneapolis. This image is from one of my favorite areas of the park, as it offers an excellent view of the game as well as a beautiful view of the downtown Minneapolis skyline.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p><b>I've played the cello for 14 years and during that time, have played in various orchestras in which I've made wonderful friends! Because of my connection to music, I have been able to travel almost every year in conjunction with an orchestra. I've been to Hawaii and played at Pearl Harbor, went on regional and country-wide domestic tours to share the Concordia College Orchestra's music with communities, and also traveled to Israel and Palestine at the end of my time with the Concordia Orchestra. Each experience taught me something new, both in terms of music skills and life skills, and I know I am a better person for having been heavily involved in musical ensembles.</b></p>
